<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Ricardo, and I’m a 21-year-old aspiring web developer from South Africa. Growing up in a country rich in culture and diversity, I’ve always been inspired by the blend of art and innovation that surrounds me. From a young age, I developed a deep interest in design, and over time, I realized that web design was the perfect way to combine my creative instincts with my love for technology and digital platforms.</p>
<p>Outside of web design, I enjoy staying active and exploring new challenges. Some of my hobbies include hitting the gym, where I’m always working to stay fit, and going on adventure hikes to experience the beauty of nature. When I’m looking to relax, I also indulge in a bit of gaming, but nothing too serious—just a fun way to unwind. These activities help me stay balanced and bring fresh energy to both my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>As I dive deeper into web design, I’m determined to refine my skills and eventually become a professional in the field. I’ve been building a strong foundation through self-study and hands-on experience, learning key coding languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also staying up to date with the latest design trends. I take pride in my attention to detail and my ability to create websites that are both visually appealing and user-friendly, always striving to leave a lasting impression.</p>
